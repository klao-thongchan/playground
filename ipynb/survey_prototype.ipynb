    "In this example, we first import the required library (pandas). We then read in the survey data from a CSV file, and use various Pandas functions to summarize the data. We count the number of respondents by gender using the value_counts() function, calculate the average age of respondents using the mean() function, and calculate the percentage of respondents who answered 'yes' to a question using the mean() function and multiplying by 100. Finally, we print the summary statistics using the print() function. Note that you'll need to replace 'survey_data.csv' with the name of your own survey data file, and 'gender', 'age', and 'question' with the names of the relevant columns in your dataset."
