    "In this example, we first import the required libraries (pandas, train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection, LogisticRegression from sklearn.linear_model, and accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics). We then read in the dataset, define the independent and dependent variables, split the data into training and testing sets, fit the model on the training data, predict the values on the test data, and calculate the accuracy of the model. Note that you'll need to replace 'dataset.csv' with the name of your own dataset file, 'feature1', 'feature2', and 'feature3' with the names of your independent variables, and 'target_variable' with the name of your dependent variable."
